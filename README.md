The SEPR34 keyboard is a is a [Reviung34split](https://github.com/gtips/reviung/tree/master/reviung34split) fork with single ProMicro, hotswap socket and soldered-in switches support and little addition. The firmware is fully compatible.
This is a WIP.

## Parts
As for the parts list, you will need:
- 2x PCB (The left and right half are different)
- 34 MX or GLP keyswitches
- 34 MX keycaps (MX low-profile for the GLP)
- 34 Hotswap sockets for MX (optional)
- 2x [Ethernet sockets](https://aliexpress.com/item/32974903992.html)
- 1x ProMicro (Warning. I don't have possibility to test ALL clones, so, please, choose cearfully)

## Gerbers
You can find the Gerber files needed to order the PCB on the ![`Gerbers`](./Gerbers) directory. Look for the .zip of whatever version you would like!
